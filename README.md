# SlowPrint
This is a simple method to be used in Java that allows output to be printed *letter-by-letter*, rather than lines being printed instantly.

### To change text speed
To change the scrolling speed of the text, put \, [number] directly after what is being printed.
30 is very fast.
40 is fast.
50 is slower but *may be choppy*
