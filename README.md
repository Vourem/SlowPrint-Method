# SlowPrint
This is a simple method that allows output to be printed *letter-by-letter*, rather than lines being printed instantly.

> To change text speed
To change the scrolling speed of the text, put \, [number] directly after what is being printed.
30 is very fast
40 is fast
50 is slow but *may be choppy*
